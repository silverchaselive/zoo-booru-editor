# zoo-booru-editor
ProximaNova/Booru-mass-editor adapted for zoo.booru.org

Based on a gist I made of the original script on 2020-12-02

See [original README](https://github.com/ProximaNova/Booru-mass-editor/blob/master/README.md) for details on how to use this user script.

## Changes
Custom changes are marked with `//@`
* On image pages, load and display the captcha prompt in the post edit form
* Skip auto-adding metadata tags about sizes (Compare comment `12.0  Add resolution tags` in this script and the original)
